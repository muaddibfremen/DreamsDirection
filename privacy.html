inform you as to the ways we collect, store, use, manage, and, in
certain circumstances, share the information you provide in
connection with any DreamsDirection game or application (&ldquo;Service&rdquo;).
Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to only
information collected from DreamsDirection through use of the Service.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">By using the Service, you agree to

non-personal information about yourself which may include but is not
limited to: (1) your age or date of birth; (2) your gender; (3)

is collected for an activity that also requires personal information,
DreamsDirection may combine your non-personal information with your personal
information in an attempt to provide you with a better user
experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to
analyze how our Service is used.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">The Service will also record game
play information such as your high scores or game session
duration. In addition to information collected as described
above, you may choose to share additional information about yourself
throughout the Service, such as in games or on message boards. Any
actions you perform with other players are considered public, and are

We use this aggregate information to better tailor the Service to

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">We may use your name, profile
picture and game play information to communicate with your friends

the bottom of this webpage. We may also disclose information about
you to our partners, in order to provide the Service, resolve service 
problems and correct errors in the Service, to communicate with you 
about the Service, to provide you with advertising and promotional 
information in connection with the Service, and to enhance your 
experience on the Service. However, we do not give our partners an 
independent right to share this information. Due to our contractual 
obligations with these third parties and the need to share information 
to deliver and support the Service, we cannot provide you with the 
opportunity to opt-out of sharing information (whether personal 
information or non-personal information) with these third parties. 
DreamsDirection, certain of its partners, and each of their contractors and

settings with the Third Party Platform. We may share this information

of your agreement and privacy settings with the Third Party Platform.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">We will share some of the
information we collect from you with vendors and other service
providers who work with us to support the internal operations of our
website and/or mobile application. For example, we use a third-party
service for ad tracking and to help us prepare website and mobile
application analytics. Our third-party ad tracking and analytics
company never sends emails, notifications, or other communications to
our end users. Your choice to opt out of ad
tracking and analytics services does not limit our ability to email
you or collect other information from you for other vendors, subject
to the terms of this privacy policy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">In all cases of data access and
collection, the information you provide will not be disclosed,
rented, leased, loaned, sold, or otherwise voluntarily distributed to
unaffiliated third parties and will be used solely for the purpose of
providing you with and improving the Service.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm"><B>Other Disclosure of Your Personal
Information</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">You understand and agree that we may
be required to disclose any personal information if required to do so
by law or in good faith believe that such disclosure is reasonably
necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, including
but not limited to a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court
order, or to protect our rights and property, or that of the public.
Note that DreamsDirection is not required to question or contest the validity
of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request
that DreamsDirection may receive.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">Additionally, in the event of a
merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar
event, customer information may be transferred to DreamsDirection&rsquo;s
successor or assignee, if permitted by and done in accordance with
applicable law.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm"><B>Others&rsquo; Information</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">You may decide to provide us with
another person&rsquo;s personal information such as email address so
that the person may be invited to join the Service. We use this
information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person that he
or she has been invited to join the Service or receive content from
the Service. We may disclose such information if required to do so in
order to comply with legal process, as described above.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm"><B>Cookies</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">A cookie is a small data file that
we transfer to your computer&rsquo;s hard disk, generally to quickly
identify a user&rsquo;s computer and to &ldquo;remember&rdquo; things
about the user&rsquo;s visit, such as your preferences or a user name
and password. The Service sends cookies to your computer when you
access or view content of a DreamsDirection game. Information contained in a
cookie may be linked to your personal information for purposes such
as improving the quality of our service, tailoring recommendations to
your interests, and making the Service easier to use. You can disable
cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use
features of the Service.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm"><B>Links</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">The Service may contain links to
other websites. The fact that the Service links to a website or
presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean
that DreamsDirection endorses or authorizes that third party, nor is it a
representation of our affiliation with that third party. DreamsDirection is in
no way responsible for the privacy policies of these other websites
to which you chose to access from the Service. Please be sure to read
the privacy policies of those websites when exiting the Service.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm"><B>Third-Party Advertising Companies</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">We may use third-party advertising
companies to serve ads on the Service. We do not provide any personal
information to third-party advertising companies on a non-aggregate
basis. Our system and the third-party advertising technology may use
aggregate information, non-personal information, DreamsDirection&rsquo;s
cookies on your hard drive and your use of the Service to target
advertisements. In addition, advertisers may use other third-party
advertising technology to target advertising on other sites. If
advertisements are served to you, a unique third-party cookie or
cookies may be placed on your computer. Similarly, third-party
advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags (also called
&ldquo;clear gifs&rdquo; or &ldquo;beacons&rdquo;) to help manage and
optimize online advertising. Beacons enable us to recognize a
browser&rsquo;s cookie when a browser visits the site on which is
beacon is located, and to learn which banner ads bring users to a
given site.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm"><B>Changing or Deleting Your
Information</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">You may review, update, correct or
delete any personal information by changing the applicable
information in your profile page on Facebook and/or other social
network(s). If you completely delete all this information, your
account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your
record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to
accommodate your request if we are not legally obligated to retain
the record. Your in-game progress will be reset to the fresh start, if you do not enter the game during at least 6 months.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm"><B>Security</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.42cm">We have put in place reasonable
technical and organizational measures designed to secure your
personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized
access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee
that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome those
measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. Also
please note that email and messaging systems are not considered
secure, so we discourage you from sending us personal information
through these mediums.</P>
